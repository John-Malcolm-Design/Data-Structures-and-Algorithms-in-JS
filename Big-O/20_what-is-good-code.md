## What is good code?
1. Readable
2. Scalable (Big-O)
    - Memory (Space Complexity)
    - Speed (Time Complexity)

### Space & Time Complexity
How does our code remember things:
1. Heap: Where we store variables that we assign.
2. Stack: Where we keep track of our function calls

### What causes Space Complexity?
- Variables
- Data Structures
- Function Calls
- Allocations
